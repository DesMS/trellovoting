      <p>Congratulations ðŸ™Œ Youâ€™ve just created a Trello Power-Up!</p>
      <p>This is the root of the Power-up, Trello uses this to start your Power-up and show UI elements (like a Card button) ðŸ‘€</p>
      <div style="padding: 10px 0;">
        <h2>What next?</h2>
        <p>Letâ€™s get the Power-Up running on a Trello board so you can see it working in a live environment.</p>
        <div style="padding: 6px 12px;">
          <p>1. Go to <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/admin">Power-up Admin</a> and update the iframe connector URL as appropriate</p>
          <p>2. Enable the Capabilities that you want to expose in the Power-Up (Enable everything to see all the features of the Notes Power-Up)</p>
          <p>3. Go to a Board and add the Power-up to a Board via the Add Power-Up Menu (Choose the 'Custom' filter on the left)</p>
          <p>4. Use your Power-up as you code and see changes to the UI in near real-time!</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 25px">
          <h2>Additional resources</h2>
          <p>Once the Power-Up has been added to a Trello board you have a few options for the next steps.</p>
          <p>To be honest, what you choose depends on your experience and preferences.</p>
          <p><i>All of the next steps are optional:</i></p>
